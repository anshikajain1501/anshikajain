<h1>Asking people what is digital India means to them.</h1>
<p>If you ask a group of people what ‘Digital India’ means to them, it is really interesting to see the variety of responses you get. For some, it is about Indian tech startups—Zomato, Ola, Urban Company, etc, that are redefining how we consume goods or services; for some it’s the legendary tech services companies—TCS, Infosys and the like that have built India’s mammoth $200 billion tech sector; for many, it is the power of social media and how it’s giving every Indian a voice; and for others, it is the increasing ease of use as more and more services, including government facilities, go online—UPI payments, Direct Benefit Transfers through Aadhaar, CoWin for vaccination, etc.</p>

<h1>How digitalization will change the world?</h1>
<p>Digital technologies have advanced more rapidly than any innovation in our history – reaching around 50 per cent of the developing world's population in only two decades and transforming societies. By enhancing connectivity, financial inclusion, access to trade and public services, technology can be a great equaliser.</p>

<h1>Digital India</h1>
<p>t’s the 75th year of India’s independence, and as I sit back to reflect on what is Digital India and what is unique in this journey, for me it is the transformation of lives and livelihoods that we are seeing at the grassroots, powered by technology and the ingenuity of India’s innovation ecosystem. And enabling the same is a quiet revolution that is at the heart of India’s transformation into Digital India—India’s ‘platformization’ story, that is, how the country has built one of the world’s most robust and comprehensive digital public-good platforms as the foundation of Digital India.</p>

<p>They say that good technology is invisible. India’s platformization strategy has quietly begun to impact each and every one of our lives: for instance, each time we use the UPI (Unified Payments Interface) to make a payment, or book a vaccination slot using CoWin, or use Aadhaar to access a service. It is the highway on which Digital India runs. And with over 20 platforms impacting over a billion lives, India is truly leading the world on building the substratum for a strong and scalable digital economy.A digital public-good platform creates enormous value by enabling seamless transactions, catalysing innovation and generating efficiency and transparency for users. India’s 20-plus public digital platforms have successfully built scale across multiple citizen services and also helped create a vibrant tech startup ecosystem that is making good use of this digital infrastructure. The rise of public digital platforms also represents a productive engagement between the government and Indian industry to work together in tackling crucial socio-economic challenges.</p>

<p>Aadhaar has been India’s most visible digital platform. When you speak with Nandan Nilekani, the visionary behind Aadhaar, even he is amazed by how rapidly this ecosystem has attained 1.3 billion registrations and how a unique identity has become the foundation for digital transformation across sectorsThe state-run Bhim UPI app clocked over 3.2 billion transactions in July 2021, marking a game-changing penetration of digital payments in India. FastTag, which became mandatory earlier this year and enables online toll collection, has already facilitated 192 million transactions. The Umang app, which offers a one-stop platform for multiple government services, has witnessed a cumulative 1.7 billion transactions.
</p>
<p>Digital platforms have also played a key role in India’s response to the covid crisis. Think of the MyGov Chatbot, which has provided validated information on key resources, or eSanjeevani, which has so far enabled 9 million telemedicine consultations, or CoWin, our vaccination gateway that has logged over 500 million vaccine doses.
</p>
<p>So why is this important and unique to India? First is the design principles: Affordability through low-cost development, interoperability with an API-driven backend, and the driving of large-scale reach. Secondly, access infrastructure: Mobile-first suitability even for the country’s non-smartphone segment, multi-lingual interfaces, and, most importantly, the leveraging of offline infrastructure of Common Service Centres in remote areas. Lastly, it is about innovation, enabling entrepreneurs to leverage these platforms and create truly unique solutions for India’s opportunities and challenges.
Open digital ecosystems today have the potential to unlock opportunities worth $700 billion for India by 2030, as per a report by BCG. The environmental, societal and governance (ECG) impact across sectors like healthcare, talent, urban governance, agriculture, law and justice, education and micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) can create new value of $500 billion-plus, and over $200 billion in savings for the country.</p>

<p>From enabling farmers to sell their produce through e-commerce platforms, to facilitating education and healthcare in the remotest parts of our nation, digitalization offers enormous transformative opportunities for India. The upcoming National Digital Health Mission: Universal Health Initiative, for example, can be a game-changer for healthcare services in the country.
</p>
<p>In the last 75 years, India has made a tremendous leap to become a robust digital economy, and the future of our country will be defined by how well we can integrate digital solutions across platforms. By the 100th year of our independence, plenty more can be achieved, for which we must strive towards developing a seamless, transparent, and inclusive digital ecosystem that is driven by India’s world-class innovation capabilities.
The country must build on its digital advantage and pivot towards a more data-driven structure of governance. These platforms have laid a strong foundation for India to attain digital maturity. For many years, the country was known as the world’s “back office". That is rapidly changing, with the Indian tech industry pivoting to become the world’s digital solutions partner. In my view, the triage of digital tech solutions, digital talent and digital platforms at scale constitute Digital India.</p>

<p>The next few years will be decisive for India’s potential to stimulate employment and get back to being one of the world’s fasting-growing large economies. As we say at Nasscom, when the world thinks ‘digital’, the world must think ‘India.</p>

<h1>The future of digitization in India</h1>
<p>Sudhir Nar</p>
<p>With the world becoming more decentralised and much more localised and

collaborative, the major ask for telecom companies is to embrace this rapid change. The ask is to build an ecosystem where digitization, connectivity and improving business environment continue to dominate and the need of the hour is to bring people together yet enabling them to work, live and operate from anywhere across the world.

While all of this sounds simple and straight, it is extremely important to see how different these different locations, people, and assets, spanned across the world, can be connected together, building a safe and secure environment. And this is where telecom will play a key role thriving on the back of modern-day technology, emerging as the most powerful weapon driving shift across sectors. As technology evolves, some of underlying trends that will unfold in the coming year and change the way the telecommunications industry work will include Digitisation, Security, Cloud and Big Data technologies.

Digitization will play a very important role in the coming year given the existing pressure that exist to eradicate costs, standardise processes, reduce variables and reshape the business to run more efficiently. Cloud services are also becoming the universally accepted 'new normal' as more and more organizations have started to fully embrace cloud services, recognizing the cost-cutting and agility-improving benefits that they provide. Data analysis will also gain traction as crucial business function with applications made to strategize intelligently and bring-in better personalisation. Another interesting trend is the emergence of intelligent network -which will be security aware, and will be able to identify the threat and alert other networks. We will see an amplifying demand for dynamic networks that enable a more agile response to major security events, especially with heightening security concerns surrounding smart cities. This virtualization of network functions will allow CIOS to connect more sensors, access more data and undertake better analytics. And with the emerging systemic security threat, organizations will benefit from intelligent networks which are able to independentldetect and deal with vulnerabilities, and alert adjacent networks. Technology advancements like network virtualisation are now allowing CIOs to connect more sensors, access more data and subsequently, carry out more analytics enabling a more agile and smart response to major events.

And all this is leading strategy of telecom companies to strengthen their market position. Trends like big data and data analytics are helping organizations to tap into customer groups, and thereafter provide best-in-class customized services to their customer base and stay ahead of the competitive game. Bringing the digital transformation within the organization and opting for a 'digital first' strategy is the best way to reach out to customers and to tap into their behavioural patterns and making a substantial difference between success and failure. And all of this is possible, thanks to a robust cyber strategy, centred on threat intelligence and penetration testing, to check for weak points in the technology ecosystem and will undoubtedly help in combating the latest generation of cyber threat. And not to forget the people that will make it happen- the people behind the machines. Maintaining a lean and efficient organisation that not only knows how to respond to its customers in real-time, but also facilitates seamless interaction within its workforce is the key to success.

The telecom sector continues to be at the focal point of growth, innovation, and disruption with more and more mobile devices and broadband connectivity continue to be embedded in the fabric of society today. With the growth in the number of "connected things, mobile and "smart" device utilization and connectivity will continue to expand. Telecommunications companies will continue to grow and expand in India, driven by the growth in the public sector like with "smart cities" and "Digital</p>

<h1>Digitalization in India</h1>
<p>Digitalization is the utilization of advanced innovations to change a plan of action and give new income and esteem delivering openings; it is the way toward moving to a computerized business

India is the fastest developing economy of the world. The Indian economy is the seventh biggest economy of the world in terms of GDP and third biggest by purchasing power parity (PPP) after US and China. The Indian economy has seen a great deal of changes from acting self-dependent to opening its entryway for worldwide exchanging by introducing LPG (Liberalization, Privatization and Globalization) in 1991 under the Finance Minister Mr. Manmohan Singh. And from that point of time, India is growing at a great pace. As indicated by the most recent Economic Survey 2015-16, the Indian economy will keep on growing more than 7% in 2016-17. As indicated by Fitch Ratings Agency, India's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) will probably develop by 7.7% in FY 2016-17 and gradually increase to 8% by FY 2018-19, driven by the gradual usage of changes in the economy, higher disposable income and change in financial action. The current strides of the Indian government have indicated positive outcomes in the growth of the GDP. As indicated by a Goldman Sachs report in September 2015, India could develop at a potential 8% from financial 2016 to 2020 if provided great implementation of advancement in the banking sector, technology adaptation, urbanization and other changes.

The 1990s likewise observed the passage of innovation in India and individuals started using PCs and computerization overwhelmed each area and now we can see the virtual world that exists and anything can occur in it from joining the world to start a war if not took care of legitimately. But in a developing country like India the process of digital soundness has been moderate and got a tremendous push to go computerized when the demonetization shook everybody. In spite of the fact that there have been different activities taken by our Honorable Prime Minister Mr. Narendra Modi, for example, Make In India, Swatch Bharat Abhiyan, Digital India and so forth, However, it was during cash crunch when individuals began perceiving the advantages of being carefully stable and how valuable it is. Our administration has accentuated continuous

cashless as it will make exchanges smoother and transparent and dispenses with the presence of parallel economy which postures risk to the peace in our nation and furthermore helped in their financial inclusion plan and has seen that demonetization has made the accounts opened under Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana operational. As appropriately said by Rajat Gandhi on financial inclusion "Regardless of what number of banks may open and what number of boots you have on the ground, if the individual does not know about the financial options that are available to him, policies, plans and budgetary instruments will mean pretty much nothing. It is necessary for a man to comprehend what to search for and know about the advantages that he can get from it. "Thus this makes the financial knowledge related education all the more vital. Financial inclusion is a quantitative term and financial literacy is more about the quality. Financial literacy concentrates on the understanding one ought to need to how to utilize and deal with the money effectively and lessen the risk and save their money from ecological changes, for example, changes in the economy, inflation and so forth. With the demonetization individuals have likewise acknowledged how essential it has progressed for them to think about their money and what influences it the most and how they can secure.

At this stage digital mindfulness has likewise picked up significance and individuals are additionally ready to take in the new modes accessible for them to deal with their money in the cashless way, During this time the online payment methods have helped individuals to survive the cash crunch they confronted and have additionally turned into the main impetus for digital literacy and financial literacy.</p>
